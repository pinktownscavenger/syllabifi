# syllabifi
This project leverages OpenAI Whisper to transcribe audio files into text and then breaks down the transcribed text into syllables. The segmented syllables can slice the original audio into syllable-level audio segments.

## Features
1. **Audio Transcription:** Convert speech in audio files to text using the Whisper model.
2. **Syllable Segmentation:** Break down the transcribed text into syllables for detailed analysis.
3. **Audio Segmentation:** Slice the original audio file into individual syllables for precise playback.

## Usage
1. **Transcribe Audio:** Convert your audio files into text.
2. **Syllabify Text:** Break down the transcribed text into syllables.
3. **Segment Audio:** Slice the audio file into syllables based on the text segmentation.
